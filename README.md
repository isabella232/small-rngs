**This repository has been archived. All contents are now included in
[the main Rand repository](https://github.com/rust-random/rand).**

This repository existed to house a collection of random number generators with
small state size. These have now been rolled back into the main repo for ease
of maintenance.

## Sub-crates

All implementations are housed in sub-crates, as follows.

### PCG

Implements a selection of PCG random number generators.

> PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms
> for random number generation. [Melissa O'Neill, Harvey Mudd College, 2014].

### Xorshift

Implements the Xorshift[^1] random number generator.

## Features and dependencies

Wherever possible, all sub-crates are `no_std` compatible, and depend only
`core` and the [`rand_core`](https://crates.io/crates/rand-core) library.

## Tests

All PRNGs feature at minimum a "true values" test comparing output against
test vectors provided as part of the specification, as well as "construction"
tests testing reproducibility of supported seeding methods.

## Benchmarks

This parent crate includes benchmarks of all sub-crates, making benchmarking
as simple as `cargo +nightly bench`.
